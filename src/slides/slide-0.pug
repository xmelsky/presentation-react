      p Before we'll start dig into technical aspects of this library. I'd like to ask you - what is this spimple function doing here? What's the purpose of this code?
      p This is as you sure know a  Framework constructor function which brings to us... a library?!. Obviously this is metaphor. But what it shows you - that this powerful and dynamic library can stand alongside with the real frameworks (instead of jQuery, whitch simply can't do that).

      | Here we see that React isn't a framework. it's a view layer only. But the design patterns applied by the development team make this library very popular amongst programmers. Today it's over 100.000 stars on github repository. and yeah, it's an open source library! How cool is that?
